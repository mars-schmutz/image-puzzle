# Image Puzzle

This is a sliding image puzzle for my Application Development class final project. It is written in Swift and developed as a macOS application. I had some previous experience developing iOS apps, but this was my first macOS desktop application. It was a little bit of a challenge to get things set up and figure out how to structure the project, but I learned a lot throughout the process. The images were created by me in Blender.

## Features

* A few different images
* A random image selector
* Shuffle tiles
* Restart current game
